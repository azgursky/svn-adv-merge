This project's goal is to provide help in merging SVN branches when a significant number of files
has been moved since the code branch.
The AdvMerge application would not commit anything to SVN nor it would change the files on the 
file system. Instead, it would generate Windows .cmd scripts based on the changes being merged and
the files move history. The generated scripts will include svn and windows commands.
